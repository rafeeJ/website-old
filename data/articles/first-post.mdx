# Why Next.js?

In this post I'm going to talk about how I use Next.js to build my blog.

## This is a h2

I love using Next.js because it's so easy to get started with. It's also really easy to add new features to your blog. For example, I added MDX support in just a few minutes.

# How to use MDX

To use MDX, you need to install the `@next/mdx` package. Then you need to add the following to your `next.config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'mdx'],
}
```

Now you can create a new MDX file in your `pages` directory. For example, I created a new file called `blog.mdx`.
