So... Another year, another blog. This time, hopefully I can stick with it. 

## Why?

Whilst I'm at work, I write a lot of documentation about the what I do. I'm hoping this new blog will allow me to do a similar thing about my personal projects.

## What did I use?

To create this blog, I am using the `next-mdx-remote` package. This package allows you to use MDX files in your Next.js project. 
MDX is a superset of Markdown that allows you to use JSX inside your Markdown files.

You can find the source code for this blog/my website here [here](https://github.com/rafeeJ/website).

## What's next?

I want to keep adding features to my site, such as:
- dark mode
- search bar
- a better way to display my blog posts.

I also want to keep up wiht my YouTube videos, so I am hoping this blog will be complementary to that.
